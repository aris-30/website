# What is this website is for?
I plan on having a personal website to showcase major projects or anything I care to share about me. My plan as of now is to focus on one long-term project, Poke Draft Duel.

# What will Poke Draft Duel be?
To help hone and showcase my backend development skills, I will try to make a pokemon battle simulator thats doesnt require large preparation times building a team. You simply will be given a choice of 2 randomly generated pokemon, where you pick one for yourself, and give the other to the opponent, which can either be a person or a bot. Each pokemon will randomly be given 2 damaging moves and 2 status moves from its movepool, along with a random ability that it's able to recieve. So all the preparation is just presing a few buttons.
